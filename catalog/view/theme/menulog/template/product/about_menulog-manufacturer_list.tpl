            <h1>Who is Menulog</h1>
            <br>We’re a proudly Australian company, having delivered our first meals in 2006. Needless to say a lot has changed since then and we’ve seen our business, and the businesses of our restaurant partners go from strength to strength since then.
            <br>
            <br>In 2015, Menulog merged with Eat Now, combining both businesses under the Menulog brand to bring Australians the best of both leading food delivery platforms. Following this, the Menulog Group was acquired by global leader, Just Eat, providing greater access to global insights and innovations for our Australian customers.
            <br>
            <br>Our mission is simple - to to make food delightfully personal by creating experiences that are full of joy. The team behind this are some of the best in the business… if we do say so ourselves.</div>
